# Docz related

### Not filty at all (just documenting change)
* Had to modify `portal/src/gatsby-theme-docz/base/Seo.js` to add the Stencil `<script>`-tags
* importing global styles in `portal/src/gatsby-browser.js`
* Adding some lines to `portal/package.json` to make lerna monorepo play nicely with Docz. 
[Now officially documented](https://www.docz.site/docs/usage-in-monorepo)
* Adding a webpack plugin to reload gatsby on file changes in stencil dist folder TODO FIGURE OUT HOW TO SEND WEBSOCKET NOTIFICATION checout https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby/blob/master/packages/gatsby/src/utils/webpack.config.js

### Eww, dude, that's nasty
* Had to overwrite `"scheduler": "^0.15.0"` to `portal/package.json` (https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/issues/1000)
* In order to get the HMR in docz working when stencil --dev updates the bundle I had to create an artificial import for all components in gatsby.browser.js (see createSymLink.ts.ejs)
‚ùó Only needed if you want to dev in portal, will increase bundle size (but not in prod)
* All `packages/components/src/**.*.mdx` files need to reside in their own `docs` directory. 
Is needed to create a symlink so HMR will work on .mdx files. I could not symlink the whole `packages/components/*/` directory
as that would make lerna complain about packages with the same name.

### ü§Æü§Æü§Æ
* Adding the `allow-scripts` value to the `<iframe sandbox>` attribute in 
`portal/src/gatsby-theme-docz/components/Playground/IframeWrapper.js`.

‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó `allow-scripts` on iframes is [STRONGLY DISCOURAGED](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/iframe#attr-sandbox). 
If you have any user generated content in your .mdx files, **YOU SHOULD NOT USE THIS SOLUTION üö®** ‚ùó‚ùó‚ùó

* Overwriting `gatsby-theme-docz/src/Header/index.js`, `gatsby-theme-docz/src/NavLink/index.js`, see [#985](https://github.com/pedronauck/docz/issues/985)
    * Adding `@emotion/core` and `ramda` packages because they are needed in these shadowed components

*  Adding the stencil `<script>` tag to the `<iframe srcdoc>` attribute in 
                                                                        `portal/src/gatsby-theme-docz/components/Playground/IframeWrapper.js`.

This is needed to make sure we can use Stencil's Webcomponents in an iframe context (which has its own `window` context)
